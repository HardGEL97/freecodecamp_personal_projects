   <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of the TB303 by Roland:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li><strong>Released in 1981:</strong> The Roland TB-303 (Transistor Bass) was originally designed as a bass synthesizer to simulate bass guitars. It was intended for musicians to accompany themselves during practice sessions or in small bands, particularly for genres like rock or pop.
     </li>
     <li><strong>Commercial Failure:</strong> The TB-303 was not commercially successful upon release. Its synthesized bass sound didnâ€™t adequately replicate a real bass guitar, which led to poor sales. Roland discontinued the production of the TB-303 in 1984 after selling less than 10,000 units.</li>
     <li><strong>Adopted by Electronic Musicians in the Late 1980s:</strong> The machine found a second life in the mid-to-late 1980s when electronic musicians in Chicago and Europe began experimenting with it. Its unique, squelchy sound became central to the emerging acid house genre.</li>
     <li><strong>The Birth of Acid House:</strong> In 1987, DJ Pierre and his group Phuture used the TB-303 to create the track "Acid Tracks," which is considered the first acid house record. The characteristic "acid" sound of the TB-303's resonant filter sweep became iconic in dance music.</li>
     <li><strong>Widespread Influence in the 1990s:</strong> Throughout the 1990s, the TB-303 became a defining sound in electronic music genres like techno, trance, and house. Its affordability in second-hand markets and distinctive tonal qualities made it a staple of underground club scenes worldwide.
