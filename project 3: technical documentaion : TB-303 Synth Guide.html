            <p>The Roland TB-303 was originally designed as a bass accompaniment for solo musicians, released in 1981.</p>
            <p>However, it was largely a commercial failure until it was rediscovered in the mid-1980s by electronic musicians.</p>
            <p>The unique "acid" sound of the TB-303 was created accidentally, and it defined the acid house genre.</p>
            <p>Despite being discontinued, the TB-303 remains influential today, with many software and hardware clones.</p>
            <p>The resurgence of this machine led to its use in many subgenres of electronic music, including techno, trance, and more.</p>

            <p>The TB-303 features a simple interface with knobs and switches used to shape the sound.</p>
            <p>The most important controls are the tuning, cutoff, resonance, envelope mod, and decay knobs.</p>
            <p>The switches allow users to select between sawtooth and square waveforms, as well as adjust patterns.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuning control for pitch adjustment</li>
                <li>Cutoff and resonance to control the filter</li>
                <li>Switches for waveform selection (sawtooth/square)</li>

            <p>The TB-303 uses a single oscillator that produces either a sawtooth or square wave.</p>
            <p>The filter is essential in shaping the sound by altering the harmonic content using the cutoff and resonance controls.</p>
            <p>Accent and slide features make it expressive, adding punch and note transitions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sawtooth and square wave options</li>
                <li>Low-pass filter for sound shaping</li>

            <p>The TB-303 has a step sequencer that allows users to program bass lines note by note.</p>
            <p>Patterns are created by adjusting pitch, duration, accents, and slide between notes.</p>
            <p>This step-by-step process enables users to create unique and repetitive bass lines, which define the acid house sound.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Step-based note entry</li>
                <li>Accents for volume and tone changes</li>
                <li>Slide for smooth note transitions</li>

            <p>The TB-303 became synonymous with the acid house movement, pioneered by artists like Phuture.</p>
            <p>Its squelchy, resonant sound has influenced techno, trance, and other electronic genres.</p>
            <p>Modern clones like the Behringer TD-3 and Rolandâ€™s TB-03 continue to bring the iconic sound to new generations of musicians.</p>
